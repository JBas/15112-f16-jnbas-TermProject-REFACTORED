This repo contains the code for a re-written version of my 2016 CS Term Project. This project was supposed to aid beginner musicians by displaying a visual tuner / pitch corrector while also displaying sheet music with which the musician can follow along.
I want to redo this project because my previous iteration suffered from poor file management, poor structure, and overall poor design strategies
